## 📍 Overview
The `fitness-buddy-tracker` is a web application designed for fitness enthusiasts to set, track, and share their fitness goals. Built using React for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, and MongoDB for the database, this MVP offers user authentication, goal management, and progress tracking features.

## 📦 Features
|    | Feature            | Description                                                                                                        |
|----|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚙️ | **Architecture**   | The codebase follows an MVC-like architecture, separating concerns into models, controllers, and routes, ensuring maintainability and scalability.           |
| 📄 | **Documentation**  | The repository includes a detailed README file that provides a comprehensive overview of the MVP, its dependencies, and usage instructions.                 |
| 🔗 | **Dependencies**   | The project uses React, React Router DOM, Axios, Tailwind CSS for the frontend, and Node.js, Express, MongoDB driver, Bcrypt, and JSON Web Token for the backend. |
| 🧩 | **Modularity**     | Components are built as reusable modules to keep code organized and easy to manage; API utilities are centralized to handle HTTP requests efficiently.|
| 🧪 | **Testing**        | Includes unit tests for key components and services using Jest and React Testing Library to ensure functionality and code quality. |
| ⚡️  | **Performance**    | Optimized HTTP requests, proper data handling and state management. Database access is managed using MongoDB's official driver for efficient queries and data retrieval.|
| 🔐 | **Security**       | Secure user authentication with password hashing using bcrypt and token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens to protect user data and API endpoints. |
| 🔀 | **Version Control**| Utilizes Git for version control and GitHub for collaboration and issue tracking. Includes scripts for streamlined development and deployment workflows.|
| 🔌 | **Integrations**   | The application uses Axios for making HTTP requests to communicate between the frontend and backend, facilitating data exchange and API interactions.        |
| 📶 | **Scalability**    | Stateless architecture of the frontend and backend to support horizontal scaling for handling increased traffic. Database is scalable on MongoDB Atlas with ability to scale-up and down as needed.          |
